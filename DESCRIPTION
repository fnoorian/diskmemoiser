Description: Caches function return values on disk, thus enabling faster
    computation by avoiding repeated re-evaluation of function calls. Saving
    results on disk allows persistence between R sessions compared to memory only
    memoisation. The API is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the memoise
    package.
